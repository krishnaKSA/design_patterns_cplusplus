Design_Pattern programs for C++


 1. FINITE STATE MACHINE PATTERN 
    - Normally state based behaviours can write using state transistions using switch cases.
    - or we can use current to next state map using state table(map or 2D array)
    - However if more state gets added at later stage, or any exit or entry functions to get executed on every state will get complicate if we go with above approach.
      Debugging will be difficult if too many cases, enter, exit added. 
    - So better to prefer the FSM design pattern, again based on the complexity of the problem.
